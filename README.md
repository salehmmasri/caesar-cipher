1. Create an encrypt function that takes in a plain text phrase and a numeric key.
2. Create a decrypt method that takes in encrypted text and numeric key which will restore the encrypted text back to its original form as long as correct key is supplied. Break the code so that an encrypted message can be transformed into its original state without access to the key. Devise a method for the computer to determine if code was broken with minimal human guidance.
